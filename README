obu is a script for tracking OpenBSD -current snapshots

USAGE:
obu <fetch|upgrade|upgradecfg|check|bootblocks|full> [file]

fetch:          download/update files
upgrade:        check and install downloaded files, install new bootblocks
upgradecfg:     update configuration (sysmerge)
check:          check downloaded files
bootblocks:     install new bootblocks (i386 specific)
full:           all of it

file:           path to configuration file to use

FEATURES:

    * Able to download via either HTTP, FTP, RSYNC or filesystem (eg NFS
      mounts)
    * Ability to install into a custom root (eg NFS mounts)
    * Ability to disable checksumming on obu upgrade. Comes in handy when
      downloading snapshots on one machine, share them via NFS to many others
      and do obu upgrade there.
    * Verifies if downloaded files are corrupt (by checking SHA256 sums)
    * Only downloads files which do not match the checksum
    * Only installs if all files match their checksums
    * sudo support (only run as root when installing files)
    * No dependencies other than rsync if you want to use that
